      Jamaica&#39;s national dish and my personal favourite. Eat with some friend dumplings pon di side - <span className="brief-highlight">YAH MON!</span> Our love for ackee and saltfish started at a young age when my mum made it for Christmas breakfast.

Be careful, if it&#39;s not ripe it&#39;s poisonous.
