    <p>
      The <span className="brief-highlight">G.O.A.T</span> for my many Caribbean food lovers. One of the most iconic dishes, right up there next to Jerk Chicken, with the Carnival scene raising its profile around the world. You can use either boneless goat or on the bone - we recommend with the bone to add flavour. If you can&#39;t find goat, you can use mutton. Some people eat curry goat with Rice & Peas however some Caribbeans insist it should only be eaten with white rice!
