      <h4>Throw It Down</h4>
      <p>You can always be certain that the warmth of the Spring sun will set the weeds growing faster than anything you’ve sown in the allotment for yourself. At this point, the hoe becomes our favourite gardening tool. The trick to successful hoe-based weeding is to carry out the task regularly. The hoe’s blades are designed to swiftly cut through the base of young weeds and, if you do this before they get out of hand, you’ll find you can whizz round the allotment in no time. The tool becomes even handier when your own plants are showing signs of life, as it can be easily steered in between rows of veg. If the weather forecast gives you a choice of conditions in which to hoe, then pick the driest, sunniest day – this will cause the uprooted weeds to shrivel and perish much more readily than on permanently wet soil.</p>
