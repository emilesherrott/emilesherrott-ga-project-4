This will stop weeds in their tracks and help prevent nutrients washing out of the soil. Consider sowing a hardy green manure â€“ there&#39;s just time to sow field beans or grazing rye now for a winter covering.</p>
      <p>Worms don&#39;t like freezing solid either, it kills them in fact. Wormery owners should move their containers into a shed or garage. The worms won&#39;t be very active if kept cool, so just ensure they&#39;ve sufficient moisture and a little food, before moving them back outside in spring. No outhouse? Bubblewrap is your answer.</p>
