Planting out from successional sowings in modules and pots is maximising the use of your space but you a probably wondering where to fit things in by now. Donâ€™t be too precious about rotational plans, plans are great until they bump head with reality.The hottest and driest months may be spent watering. You can reduce water loss and so save yourself some time. Mulching with a layer of organic matter will help preserve moisture but may encourage slugs so will need to compensate for this with an organic repellent.</p>
