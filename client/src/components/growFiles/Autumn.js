      <p>Autumn can be regarded as the start of the new gardening year. Now is a good time to take stock of the successes and failures of this year and make plans to ensure that next year will be the best ever. Also, if you are starting out from scratch you will have plenty of time to prepare the ground whilst planning your dream allotment.</p>
      <p>Wasps are attracted this time of year due to the ripening of fruit. If you have anything a wasp may like hang wasp traps in fruit trees and protect any grapes from wasps with netting or mesh. But also remember that wasps are the gardener&#39;s friend because they are major predators of aphids and caterpillars at this time of the year.</p>
