Loosen the roots of the herb plants to allow them to take root easily, then slide them into the wells. Cover with remaining dirt, up to the top of the pot.</p>
      <p className="grow-title">Herb container gardens are popular for many reasons. Even if you have miles of property and gardens galore, it&#39;s convenient to be able to step just out your door and pick a handful of fresh herbs from a beautiful container garden. Plant maintenance is also more convenient with containers, and there are fewer problems with weeds and critters getting into your crops.</p>
